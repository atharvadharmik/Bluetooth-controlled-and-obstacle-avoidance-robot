Obstacle avoidance Robots are made to prevent accidents while navigating over uncharted territory. Obstacle avoiding robot detects obstructions in its route, avoids them, and then continues to run. Robot navigation techniques include things like wall-following, edge recognition, line-following, and many others. Edge detection is a more generic and widely used approach for obstacle avoidance. The necessity for the robot to halt in front of an obstruction in order to obtain a more precise measurement is a drawback of obstacle avoidance based on edge detection. All mobile robots include some kind of collision avoidance, from simple algorithms that detect an impediment and cause the robot to halt in order to prevent a collision to more complex algorithms that allow the robot to avoid collisions altogether. The latter methods require both the identification of a barrier and some type of quantitative measurement pertaining to the obstacle's size, making them more difficult.
